// OpenRTB extensions ("ext" fields in the spec & JSON representation)
// are represented here by Protocol Buffer extensions. This proto only
// reserves the range of IDs 100-9999 at every extensible object. Beware
// that upstream authors of a message may reserve extension IDs for their
// own use, so an author is not free to propagate a message adding their
// own extensions.

// OpenRTB 2.0: The top-level bid request object contains a globally unique
// bid request or auction ID. This id attribute is required as is at least one
// impression object (Section 3.2.2). Other attributes in this top-level object
// establish rules and restrictions that apply to all impressions being offered.
//
// There are also several subordinate objects that provide detailed data to
// potential buyers. Among these are the Site and App objects, which describe
// the type of published media in which the impression(s) appear.
// These objects are highly recommended, but only one applies to a given
// bid request depending on whether the media is browser-based web content
// or a non-browser application, respectively.
